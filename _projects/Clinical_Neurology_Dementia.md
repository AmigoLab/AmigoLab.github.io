## Intro	

It's normal for your memory to be affected by stress, tiredness, certain illnesses and medicines. But if you're becoming increasingly forgetful, particularly if you're over the age of 65, it's a good idea to talk to a GP about the early signs of dementia.

[Memory loss](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/memory-loss-amnesia/) can be annoying if it happens occasionally, but if it's affecting your daily life, or it's worrying you, or someone you know, you should get help from a GP. Dementia is not only about memory loss. It can also affect the way you speak, think, feel and behave. It's also important to remember that dementia is not a natural part of ageing.

Dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning. There are many different causes of dementia, and many different types. People often get confused about the difference between Alzheimer's disease and dementia. [Alzheimer's disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alzheimers-disease/) is a type of dementia and, together with [vascular dementia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vascular-dementia/), makes up the majority of cases.
