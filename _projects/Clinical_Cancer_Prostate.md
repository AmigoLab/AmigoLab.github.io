## Intro	

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK. It usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs for many years.

Symptoms of prostate cancer do not usually appear until the prostate is large enough to affect the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the penis (urethra).

When this happens, you may notice things like:

- an increased need to pee
- straining while you pee
- a feeling that your bladder has not fully emptied

These symptoms should not be ignored, but they do not mean you have prostate cancer.
