A vectorial representation of the vascular network, which embodies quantitative features such as location, direction, scale, and bifurcations, has many potential cardio- and neuro-vascular applications.

VTrails stands as an end-to-end approach to extract geodesic vascular minimum spanning trees from angiographic data by solving a connectivity-optimised anisotropic level-set over a voxel-wise tensor field representing the orientation of the underlying vasculature.

VTrails has been presented at the biennial conference Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI 2017) [1] [Full-Text]:https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03111, and further published on the IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging journal [2] [Full-Text]:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8421255/.
