Artificial general intelligence is the hypothetical intelligence of a machine capable of learning and understanding any human-learnable intellectual task. Our aims are a bit narrower - we focus on medical intelligence and clinical impact. 

The Artificial Medical Intelligence Group (AMIGO) @ KCL, part of the School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, is a highly-multidisciplinary group researchers comprised of engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, physicists and clinicians, using artificial intelligence, statistical and physics modelling techniques to explore large real-world hospital-derived datasets, in order to tackle key medical issues.
