Over an academic career using brain imaging to investigate emotion, language, and memory, my interest has converged on questions that help patients. I recently conducted a study on how patients recover from memory impairment after stroke. With advances in both the scientific literature and computing power, the time is right for large-scale studies looking at thousands of routine clinical images, not just tens of specialized research images. We can now use artificial intelligence algorithms to pick out features in complex data that can inform diagnosis and prognosis. As a newcomer to the world of artificial intelligence, my aim is to learn about these techniques and use my practical knowledge of clinical trials and experience working with clinicians to make these esoteric techniques usable on the front line.
