I am a Research Fellow at KCL, interested in developing machine learning-based tools and pipelines that can be  deployed in the clinic. Prior to KCL, I did my PhD at UCL where I developed a physics-based MRI simulator, and worked at a startup building deep-learning models to analyse retinal images.
