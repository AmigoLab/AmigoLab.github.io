I studied Biomedical Engineering at the Polytechnical University of Madrid, then worked for 2 years as a Global Support Engineer at SAP S.E. In 2018, I moved to London to read a Master of Science in Bioengineering at Imperial College London, where I did a project applying Deep Learning to Cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging denoising. In 2019, I started my 4-years program at the Smart Medical Imaging CDT, working on Deep Learning to produce a generative model of the diseased human brain.
