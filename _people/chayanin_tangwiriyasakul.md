I am an engineer/mathematician with strong interests in Artificial intelligence and brain modelling. My experiences cover many aspects of AI and data modalities. My ultimate goal is to understand how the human brain work and able to develop an artificial system that could work like our brain. Right now, I am working in the project AI-Neurology focusing on applying/developing an algorithm to segment vascular structure in the human brain using LSTM, U-Net.
