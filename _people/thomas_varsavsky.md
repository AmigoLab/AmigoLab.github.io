I'm a PhD student supervised by Prof. Parashkev Nachev at University College London and M. Jorge Cardoso at King's College London. After finishing my BSc in Physics at Imperial College London I decided to do the Machine Learning MSc at UCL. I worked at Tractable, a computer vision company in London for 18 months before starting this PhD program in Jan 2018. I'm interested in automating various aspects of neuroradiology, with a focus on large messy clinical datasets and natural language processing of radiological report text.
